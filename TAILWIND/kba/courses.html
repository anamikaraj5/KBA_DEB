        <p class="p-4">Blockchain is a method of recording information that makes it impossible or difficult for the system to be changed, hacked, or manipulated. It is a distributed ledger that duplicates and distributes transactions across the network of computers participating in it.

            Blockchain technology is a structure that stores transactional records, also known as the block, of the public in several databases, known as the “chain,” in a network connected through peer-to-peer nodes. Typically, this storage is referred to as a ‘digital ledger.’</p>
